Demographic models in species delimitation
==========================================

There are many ways to delimit species using genetic data, but one approach is to use genetic data to infer a demogrpahic model. 
Demographic models include information about population divergences, population size changes, and gene flow between populations.
Knowing this information about your focal group may help you to arrive at more biologically meaningful species delimitations (Smith and Carstens, 2020, Evolution).
